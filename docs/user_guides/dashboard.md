Chaos Dashboard is a Web UI for managing, designing, monitoring Chaos Experiments. Stay tuned for more supports or join us in making it happen.

# Install Dashboard

You can install Chaos Mesh with dashboard by executing command below:

```bash
helm install chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.create=true
```

If you have already installed Chaos Mesh, upgrade it by executing:

```bash
helm upgrade chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.create=true
```

### Security Mode

Dashboard supports security mode, where users are required to log in using tokens generated by K8s against ServiceAccount, giving Dashboard control over the user's permissions.

Security Mode is enabled by default when installing with Helm. You can disable it by executing:

```bash
helm upgrade chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.securityMode=false
```

**Note:**
>
> 1. The security mode can be turned off only in test scenarios, and it is strongly recommended to turn it on in other cases.
> 2. The security mode is disabled if you install Chaos Mesh by `install.sh`, which is suitable for trying Chaos Mesh out.

# Access Dashboard

A typical way to access it is to use `kubectl port-forward`:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n chaos-testing svc/chaos-dashboard 2333:2333
```

Then you can access [`http://localhost:2333`](http://localhost:2333) in the browser.

# Use Dashboard

## Login

If Dahsboard is installed with security mode, you need to fill in `Name` and `Token` when you open Dashboard in the browser. The Name can be any Name used to identify the Token, and a meaningful Name is suggested, such as `Clutser-Manager`, to indicate that the Token has permissions managed chaos experiment in the cluster.
